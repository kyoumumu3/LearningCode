# Reference of Code

A bit of introduction here,
<br><br><br>


## What you will get here?

Shortly, not much. It's just some of the code that I write while I am learning any programming language. You will find only one this time, but maybe (just maybe), it will widen.

Yes, it was just a code to test my knowledge everytime I meet something new.

## Why you put it at Github?

Maybe you won't ask it, but let me being a bit of narcisstic.
I ever thinking of making this because I just want to save it as a memoria, and something that I can read and refer back if I lost (I think I will at least lost once, so better prepare for the worst).

Maybe you all who visiting this (I think everyone wouldn't) can make use of this. At least it can be "handy" for you? Who knows.

## End of words

Just it, so let me close this mumbling.
See ya'

<strong> NB : Maybe you will see some variables or classes that has a reference to Resident Evil fiction. Just ignore that, I always think of random names that comes to my mind when I create variables or classes. It's a bad habit, actually. Hope I can leave this habit, hope you not follow it. </strong>
